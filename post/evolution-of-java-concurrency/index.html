                                        <p>Java’s concurrency support has changed significantly over the last 20 years to mostly reflect the changes in hardware, software systems, and programming concepts.</p>
<p>Going through the evolution of Java concurrency support can help in understanding the reason for the new additions and their roles.</p>
<h2 id="javas-initial-concurrency-support">Java’s Initial Concurrency Support</h2>
<p>Initially, Java had threads and built-in monitor objects, which are supported by locks (via synchronized classes and methods), Runnable and Thread interfaces.</p>
<p>The built-in monitor objects allow mutual exclusion and coordination among threads.</p>
<p>The focus was on basic multi-threading and synchronisation primitives.</p>
<p>They are efficient but low-level and very limited in capabilities. They are also difficult and error-prone to use, which can cause accidental complexity</p>
<p>As per JDK 1.x release, there were only few classes present in this initial release. To be very specific, there classes/interfaces were:</p>
<ul>
<li>java.lang.Thread</li>
<li>java.lang.ThreadGroup</li>
<li>java.lang.Runnable</li>
<li>java.lang.Process</li>
<li>java.lang.ThreadDeath</li>
</ul>
<p>and some exception classes</p>
<ul>
<li>java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException</li>
<li>java.lang.IllegalStateException</li>
<li>java.lang.IllegalThreadStateException.</li>
</ul>
<p>It also had few synchronized collections e.g. <strong>java.util.Hashtable</strong>.<br>
JDK 1.2 and JDK 1.3 had no noticeable changes related to multi-threading. (Correct me if I have missed anything).</p>
<p>JDK 1.4, there were few JVM level changes to suspend/resume multiple threads with single call. But no major API changes were present.</p>
<h2 id="java-5-concurrency-changes">Java 5 Concurrency Changes</h2>
<p>n 2004, Java 5 introduced new concurrency support: Java Executor framework, synchronizers, blocking queues, atomics, and concurrent collections.</p>
<p>JDK 1.5 was first big release after JDK 1.x; and it had included multiple concurrency utilities. <strong>Executor</strong>, <strong>semaphore</strong>, <strong>mutex</strong>, <strong>barrier</strong>, <strong>latches</strong>, concurrent collections and blocking queues; all were included in this release itself. The biggest change in java multi-threading applications cloud happened in this release.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read full set of changes in this link: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/concurrency/overview.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a big step forward with better support compared to the earlier one.</p>
<p>The idea of thread pools as a higher-level idea capturing the power of threads allowed developers to decouple task submission from task execution.</p>
<p>It also enabled coarse-grained task parallelism (there was not a lot of computing power at that time), which is</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit tasks to execute so that they can run in a pool of worker threads</li>
<li>The results are computed and put into a queue</li>
<li>The queue can be accessed by other threads to get the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also by Future and Callable interfaces, it provided higher-level and result-returning variants of Runnable and Thread.</p>
<p>It is feature-rich and optimized but also difficult and error-prone as still uses low-levels of abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="java-7-concurrency-changes">Java 7 Concurrency Changes</h2>
<p>Java 1.7 added foundational parallelism support.</p>
<p>It provided data parallelism that runs the same tasks on different data elements. It added RecursiveTask to support fork-join approach of divide-and-conquer algorithms.</p>
<p>Fork-join approach is powerful and scalable but tricky to program correctly</p>
<h2 id="java-8-concurrency-changes">Java 8 Concurrency Changes</h2>
<p>Java 1.8 provided advanced level parallelism, which is support for streams and their parallel processing by building on the newly added support for lambdas.</p>
<p>So, the focus was on functional programming for data parallelism and asynchronous programming. It added support for composing Futures via the CompletableFutures( implementation of Future)</p>
<p>It provided an effective balance between productivity and performance</p>
<h2 id="java-9-concurrency-changes">Java 9 Concurrency Changes</h2>
<p>Changes Java 9, provided explicit support for distributed asynchronous programming.</p>
<p>It is basically the Flow API based on the publish-subscribe protocol, including back-pressure, and forms the basis for reactive programming. It is a set of interfaces for publish-subscribe model to standardize the concepts to maximize the interoperability of different implementations.</p>
<h2 id="which-one-to-use">Which one to use?</h2>
<p>As the new changes came in, the level of abstraction has been increased.</p>
<p>It is good to learn the constructs on all levels.</p>
<p>Learning low-level constructs will help in understanding the high-level constructs better and how they work underneath.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, it is always good to use the simplest and most efficient option. So, it is better to start with using the most high-level option, which is Java 8’s concurrency/parallelism frameworks (i.e parallel streams and completable futures) or Java 9’s reactive programming) if it fits your needs. Consider using lower-level constructs only if needed, which should be rare at the application level.</p>
